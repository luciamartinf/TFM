# Functional Analysis with R

### Lucía Martín Fernández

This folder contains a R script proposed for functional analysis of the output results generated with *emapper-profiler*. 

Two analysis are performed in this context:

* [KEGG orthologs analysis](KEGG_orthologs)
* [Novel gene families analysis](NovelGeneFamilies)

Each folder contains:

- An R script
- The generated html report
- A folder with the differential functional abundance file results.
